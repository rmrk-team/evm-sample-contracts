# Nestable

The concept of nested NFTs refers to NFTs being able to own other NFTs.

At its core, the principle is simple: the owner of an NFT does not have to be an externally owned account or a smart
contract, it can also be a specific NFT.

The process of sending an NFT into another is functionally identical to sending it to another user. The process of
sending an NFT out of another NFT involves issuing a transaction from the address which owns the parent.

Some NFTs can be configured with special conditions for parent-child relationships. For example:

- some parent NFTs will allow the owner of a child NFT to withdraw that child at any time (e.g. virtual land containing
an avatar)
- some parent NFTs will be prohibited from executing certain interactions on a child (e.g. the owner of a house in which
someone else's avatar is a guest should not be able to BURN the guest... probably)
- some parent NFTs will have special withdrawal conditions, like a music NFT that accepts music stems. The stems can be
removed by their owners until a certain number of co-composers upvote a stem enough, or until the owner of the parent
music track seals and "publishes" it

## Abstract

In this tutorial we will examine the Nestable RMRK block using two examples:

- [SimpleNestable](./SimpleNestable.sol) is a minimal implementation of the Nestable RMRK block.
- [AdvancedNestable](./AdvancedNestable.sol) is a more customizable implementation of the Nestable RMRK block.

Let's first examine the simple, minimal, implementation and then move on to the advanced one.

## SimpleNestable

The `SimpleNestable` example uses the
[`RMRKNestableImpl`](https://github.com/rmrk-team/evm/blob/dev/contracts/implementations/RMRKNestableImpl.sol). It is used
by importing it using the `import` statement below the `pragma` definition:

````solidity
import "@rmrk-team/evm-contracts/contracts/implementations/RMRKNestableImpl.sol";
````

Once the `RMRKNestableImpl.sol` is imported into our file, we can set the inheritace of our smart contract:

````solidity
contract SimpleNestable is RMRKNestableImpl {
    
}
````

The `RMRKNestableImpl` implements all of the required functionality of the Nested RMRK lego. It implements minting of
parent NFTs as well as child NFTs. Transferring and burning the NFTs is also implemented.

**WARNING: The `RMRKNestableImpl` only has minimal access control implemented. If you intend to use it, make sure to
define your own, otherwise your smart contracts are at risk of unexpected behaviour.**

The `constructor` to initialize the `RMRKNestableImpl` accepts the following arguments:

- `name_`: `string` argument that should represent the name of the NFT collection
- `symbol_`: `string` argument that should represent the symbol of the NFT collection
- `collectionMetadata_`: `string` argument that defines the metadata URI of the whole collection
- `tokenURI_`: `string` argument that defines the base URI of the token metadata
- `data`: struct type of argument providing a number of initialization values, used to avoid initialization transaction
  being reverted due to passing too many parameters

**NOTE: The `InitData` struct is used to pass the initialization parameters to the implementation smart contract. This
is done so that the execution of the deploy transaction doesn't revert because we are trying to pass to many arguments.

The `InitData` struct contains the following fields:

[
    erc20TokenAddress,
    tokenUriIsEnumerable,
    royaltyRecipient,
    royaltyPercentageBps, // Expressed in basis points
    maxSupply,
    pricePerMint
]**

**NOTE: Basis points are the smallest supported denomination of percent. In our case this is one hundreth of a percent.
This means that 1 basis point equals 0.01% and 10000 basis points equal 100%. So for example, if you want to set royalty
percentage to 5%, the `royaltyPercentageBps` value should be 500.**

In order to properly initiate the inherited smart contract, our smart contract needs to accept the arguments, mentioned
above, in the `constructor` and pass them to `RMRKNestableImpl`:

````solidity
    constructor(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol,
        string memory collectionMetadata,
        string memory tokenURI,
        InitData memory data
    )
        RMRKNestableImpl(
            name,
            symbol,
            collectionMetadata,
            tokenURI,
            data
        )
    {}
````

            tokenURI,

        )
    {}
}
````

</details>

### RMRKNestableImpl

Let's take a moment to examine the core of this implementation, the `RMRKNestableImpl`.

It uses the `RMRKRoyalties`, `RMRKNestable`, `RMRKCollectionMetadata` and `RMRKMintingUtils` smart contracts from `RMRK`
stack. To dive deeper into their operation, please refer to their respective documentation.

Two errors are defined:

````solidity
error RMRKMintUnderpriced();
error RMRKMintZero();
````

`RMRKMintUnderpriced()` is used when not enough value is used when attempting to mint a token and `RMRKMintZero()` is
used when attempting to mint 0 tokens.

#### `mint`

The `mint` function is used to mint parent NFTs and accepts two arguments:

- `to`: `address` type of argument that specifies who should receive the newly minted tokens
- `numToMint`: `uint256` type of argument that specifies how many tokens should be minted

There are a few constraints to this function:

- after minting, the total number of tokens should not exceed the maximum allowed supply
- attempthing to mint 0 tokens is not allowed as it makes no sense to pay for the gas without any effect
- value should accompany transaction equal to a price per mint multiplied by the `numToMint`

#### `nestMint`

The `nestMint` function is used to mint child NFTs to be owned by the parent NFT and accepts three arguments:

- `to`: `address` type of argument specifying the address of the smart contract to which the parent NFT belongs to
- `numToMint`: `uint256` type of argument specifying the amount of tokens to be minted
- `destinationId`: `uint256` type of argument specifying the ID of the parent NFT to which to mint the child NFT

The constraints of `nestMint` are similar to the ones set out for `mint` function.

#### `transfer`

Can only be called by a direct owner or a parent NFT's smart contract or a caller that was given the allowance and is
used to transfer the NFT to the specified address.

#### `nestTransfer`

Can only be called by a direct owner or a parent NFT's smart contract or a caller that was given the allowance and is
used to transfer the NFT to another NFT residing in a specified contract. This will nest the given NFT into the
specified one.

#### `tokenURI`

The `tokenURI` function is used to get the metadata URI of the given token and accepts one argument:

- `uint256` type of argument specifying the ID of the token

#### `updateRoyaltyRecipient`

The `updateRoyaltyRecipient` function is used to update the royalty recipient and accepts one argument:

- `newRoyaltyRecipient`: `address` type of argument specifying the address of the new beneficiary recipient

### Deploy script

The deploy script for the `SimpleNestable` smart contract resides in the
[`deployNestable.ts`](../../scripts/deployNestable.ts).

The script uses the `ethers`, `SimpleNestable` and `ContractTransactio` imports. The empty deploy script should look like
this:

````typescript
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
import { SimpleNestable } from "../typechain-types";
import { ContractTransaction } from "ethers";

async function main() {

}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
````

Before we can deploy the parent and child smart contracts, we should prepare the constants that we will use in the
script:

````typescript
  const pricePerMint = ethers.utils.parseEther("0.0001");
  const totalTokens = 5;
  const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners();
````

Now that the constants are ready, we can deploy the smart contracts and log the addresses of the contracts to the
console:

````typescript
  const contractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("SimpleNestable");
  const parent: SimpleNestable = await contractFactory.deploy(
    "Kanaria",
    "KAN",
    "ipfs://collectionMeta",
    "ipfs://tokenMeta",
    {
      erc20TokenAddress: ethers.constants.AddressZero,
      tokenUriIsEnumerable: true,
      royaltyRecipient: await owner.getAddress(),
      royaltyPercentageBps: 10,
      maxSupply: 1000,
      pricePerMint: pricePerMint
    }
  );
  const child: SimpleNestable = await contractFactory.deploy(
    "Chunky",
    "CHN",
    "ipfs://collectionMeta",
    "ipfs://tokenMeta",
    {
      erc20TokenAddress: ethers.constants.AddressZero,
      tokenUriIsEnumerable: true,
      royaltyRecipient: await owner.getAddress(),
      royaltyPercentageBps: 10,
      maxSupply: 1000,
      pricePerMint: pricePerMint
    }
  );


  await parent.deployed();
  await child.deployed();
  console.log(
    `Sample contracts deployed to ${parent.address} and ${child.address}`
  );
````

A custom script added to [`package.json`](../../package.json) allows us to easily run the script:

````json
  "scripts": {
    "deploy-nestable": "hardhat run scripts/deployNestable.ts"
  }
````

Using the script with `npm run deploy-nestable` should return the following output:

````shell
npm run deploy-nestable

> @rmrk-team/evm-contract-samples@0.1.0 deploy-nestable
> hardhat run scripts/deployNestable.ts

````

### User journey

With the deploy script ready, we can examine how the journey of a user using nestable would look like using these two
smart contracts.

The base of it is the same as the deploy script, as we need to deploy the smart contracts in order to interact with
them:

````typescript
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
import { SimpleNestable } from "../typechain-types";
import { ContractTransaction } from "ethers";

async function main() {
  const pricePerMint = ethers.utils.parseEther("0.0001");
  const totalTokens = 5;
  const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners();

  const contractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("SimpleNestable");
  const parent: SimpleNestable = await contractFactory.deploy(
    "Kanaria",
    "KAN",
    "ipfs://collectionMeta",
    "ipfs://tokenMeta",
    {
      erc20TokenAddress: ethers.constants.AddressZero,
      tokenUriIsEnumerable: true,
      royaltyRecipient: await owner.getAddress(),
      royaltyPercentageBps: 10,
      maxSupply: 1000,
      pricePerMint: pricePerMint
    }
  );
  const child: SimpleNestable = await contractFactory.deploy(
    "Chunky",
    "CHN",
    "ipfs://collectionMeta",
    "ipfs://tokenMeta",
    {
      erc20TokenAddress: ethers.constants.AddressZero,
      tokenUriIsEnumerable: true,
      royaltyRecipient: await owner.getAddress(),
      royaltyPercentageBps: 10,
      maxSupply: 1000,
      pricePerMint: pricePerMint
    }
  );

  await parent.deployed();
  await child.deployed();
  console.log(
    `Sample contracts deployed to ${parent.address} and ${child.address}`
  );
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
````

First thing that needs to be done after the smart contracts are deployed is to mint the NFTs. Minting the parent NFT is
a straightforward process. We will use the `totalTokens` constant in order to specify how many of the parent tokens to
mint:

````typescript
  console.log("Minting parent NFTs");
  let tx = await parent.mint(owner.address, totalTokens, {
    value: pricePerMint.mul(totalTokens),
  });
  await tx.wait();
  console.log("Minted totalTokens tokens");
  let totalSupply = await parent.totalSupply();
  console.log("Total parent tokens: %s", totalSupply);
````

Minting child NFTs that should be nested is a different process. We will mint 2 nested NFTs for each parent NFT. If we
examine the `nestMint` call that is being prepared, we can see that the first argument is the parent smart contract
address, the second one is the amount of child NFTs to be nested to the given token and third is the ID of the parent
token to which to nest the child. In this script, we will build a set of transactions to mint the nested tokens and then
send them once they are all ready:

````typescript
  console.log("Minting child NFTs");
  let allTx: ContractTransaction[] = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= totalTokens; i++) {
    let tx = await child.nestMint(parent.address, 2, i, {
      value: pricePerMint.mul(2),
    });
    allTx.push(tx);
  }
  console.log("Added 2 chunkies per kanaria");
  console.log("Awaiting for all tx to finish...");
  await Promise.all(allTx.map((tx) => tx.wait()));

  totalSupply = await child.totalSupply();
  console.log("Total child tokens: %s", totalSupply);
````

Once the child NFTs are minted, we can examine the difference between `ownerOf` and `directOwnerOf` functions. The former should return the address of the root owner (which should be the `owner`'s address in our case) and the latter should return the array of values related to intended parent. The array is structured like this:

````json
[
  address of the owner,
  token ID of the parent NFT,
  isNft boolean value
]
````

In our case, the address of the owner should equal the parent token's smart contract, the ID should equal the parent
NFT's ID and the boolean value of `isNft` should be set to `true`. If we would be calling the `directOwnerOf` one the
parent NFT, the owner should be the same as the one returned from the `ownerOf`, ID should equal 0 and the `isNft` value
should be set to `false`. The section covering these calls shoudl look like this:

````typescript
  console.log("Inspecting child NFT with the ID of 1");
  let parentId = await child.ownerOf(1);
  let rmrkParent = await child.directOwnerOf(1);
  console.log("Chunky's id 1 owner  is ", parentId);
  console.log("Chunky's id 1 rmrk owner is ", rmrkParent);
  console.log("Parent address: ", parent.address);
````

For the nestable process to be completed, the `acceptChild` method should be called on the parent NFT:

````typescript
  console.log("Accepting the fist child NFT for the parent NFT with ID 1");
  tx = await parent.acceptChild(1, 0, child.address, 1);
  await tx.wait();
````

The section of the script above accepted the child NFT with the ID of `1` at the index `0` for the parent NFT with the ID of `1`
in the parent NFT's smart contract.

**NOTE: When accepting the nested NFTs, the index of the pending NFT represents its index in a FIFO like stack. So having 2
NFTs in the pending stack, and accepting the one with the index of 0 will move the next one to this spot. Accepting the
second NFT from the stack, after the first one was already accepted, should then be done by accepting the pending NFT
with index of 0. So two identical calls in succession should accept both pending NFTs.**

The parent NFT with ID 1 now has one accepted and one pending child NFTs. We can examine both using the `childrenOf` and
`pendingChildren` methods:

````typescript
  console.log("Exaimning accepted and pending children of parent NFT with ID 1");
  console.log("Children: ", await parent.childrenOf(1));
  console.log("Pending: ", await parent.pendingChildrenOf(1));
````

Both of these methods return the array of tokens contained in the list, be it for child NFTs or for pending NFTs. The
array contains two values:

- `contractAddress` is the address of the child NFT's smart contract
- `tokenId` is the ID of the child NFT in its smart contract

Once the NFT is nested, it can also be unnested. When doing so, the owner of the token should be specified, as they will
be the ones owning the token from that point on (or until they nest or sell it). Additionally pending status has to be
passed, as the procedure to unnest differs for the NFTs that have already been accepted from those that are still
pending (passing `flase` indicates that the child NFT has already been nested). We will remove the nested NFT with
nestable ID of 0 from the parent NFT with ID 1:

````typescript
  console.log("Removing the nested NFT from the parent token with the ID of 1");
  tx = await parent.transferChild(1, owner.address, 0, 0, child.address, 1, false, "0x");
  await tx.wait();
````

**NOTE: Unnestable the child NFT is done in the similar manner as accepting a pending child NFT. Once the nested NFT at
ID 0 has been unnested the following NFT's IDs are reduced by 1.**

Finally, let's observe the child NFT that we just unnested. We will use the `ownerOf` and `directOwnerOf` methods to
observe it:

````typescript
  parentId = await child.ownerOf(1);
  rmrkParent = await child.directOwnerOf(1);
  console.log("Chunky's id 1 parent is ", parentId);
  console.log("Chunky's id 1 rmrk owner is ", rmrkParent);
````

The `directOwnerOf` should return the address of the `owner` and the ID should be `0` as well as `isNft` should be
`false`.

With the user journey script concluded, we can add a custom helper to the [`package.json`](../../package.json) to make
running it easier:

````json
    "user-journey-nestable": "hardhat run scripts/nestableUserJourney.ts"
````

Running it using `npm run user-journey-nestable` should return the following output:

````shell
npm run user-journey-nestable

> @rmrk-team/evm-contract-samples@0.1.0 user-journey-nestable
> hardhat run scripts/nestableUserJourney.ts

````

This concludes our work on the [`SimpleNestable.sol`](./SimpleNestable.sol). We can now move on to examining the
[`AdvancedNestable.sol`](./AdvancedNestable.sol).

## AdvancedNestable

The `AdvancedNestable` smart contract allows for more flexibility when using the nestable lego. It implements minimum
required implementation in order to be compatible with RMRK nestable, but leaves more business logic implementation
freedom to the developer. It uses the
[`RMRKNestable.sol`](https://github.com/rmrk-team/evm/blob/dev/contracts/RMRK/nestable/RMRKNestable.sol) import to gain
access to the Nestable lego:

````solidity
import "@rmrk-team/evm-contracts/contracts/RMRK/nestable/RMRKNestable.sol";
````

We only need `name` and `symbol` of the NFT in order to properly initialize it after the `AdvancedNestable` inherits it:

````solidity
contract AdvancedNestable is RMRKNestable {
    // NOTE: Additional custom arguments can be added to the constructor based on your needs.
    constructor(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol
    )
        RMRKNestable(name, symbol)
    {
        // Custom optional: constructor logic
    }
}
````

This is all that is required in order to get you started with implementing the Nested RMRK lego.

<details>
<summary>The minimal <strong><i>AdvancedNestable.sol</i></strong> should look like this:</summary>

````solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

pragma solidity ^0.8.16;

import "@rmrk-team/evm-contracts/contracts/RMRK/nestable/RMRKNestable.sol";


contract AdvancedNestable is RMRKNestable {
    // NOTE: Additional custom arguments can be added to the constructor based on your needs.
    constructor(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol
    )
        RMRKNestable(name, symbol)
    {
        // Custom optional: constructor logic
    }
}
````

</details>

Using `RMRKNestable` requires custom implementation of minting logic. Available internal functions to use when writing it
are:

- `_mint(address to, uint256 tokenId)`
- `_safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId)`
- `_safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data)`
- `_nestMint(address to, uint256 tokenId, uint256 destinationId)`

The latter is used to nest mint the NFT directly to the parent NFT. If you intend to support it at the minting stage,
you should implement it in your smart contract.

In addition to the minting functions, you should also implement the burning and transfer functions if they apply to your
use case:

- `_burn(uint256 tokenId)`
- `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`
- `nestTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, uint256 destinationId)`

Any additional function supporting your NFT use case and utility can also be added. Remember to thoroughly test your
smart contracts with extensive test suites and define strict access control rules for the functions that you implement.

Happy nesting! 🐣
